            <li>½ teaspoon of garlic powder</li>
            <li>½ teaspoon of onion powder</li>
            <li>3(4 ounce) packets of saltine crackers (crushed)</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
            <li>6 thin cut pork chops</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</li>
            <li>
                In a shallow bowl or pie plate, 
                whisk eggs with garlic powder and 
                onion powder. Place cracker crumbs 
                on a separate plate. Heat the oil 
                in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
                Dip pork chops into the egg, then 
                press in the cracker crumbs to coat. 
                Fry in the hot oil for 2 to 3 minutes 
                per side, just until golden brown. 
                Remove to a baking sheet.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake for 45 minutes in the preheated oven, 
                turning once. Serve immediately.
